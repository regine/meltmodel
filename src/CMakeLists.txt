# Add each sublibrary of melt_mod as a static library
# This is not technically what they are, since Meltmod 
# works in a mutable global state, and most of the
# functions in these files rely on, and manipulate that
# global state, they really mean little in a vacuum.
#
# That being said, it doesn't make a lot of sense to
# have to recompile everything every time, they've been
# broken up as much as possible, and it's left to the
# linker to make sure the symbols get resolved in the end.
# 
# The caveat here being that the circular dependencies
# between many of these files can confuse the linker,
# OS X 10.6 doesn't seem to have a problem, but Ubuntu 12.4
# and later sure can.
#
# Linker errors can be fixed as below, by explicitly
# linking these guys together, as with snowmodel and turbul.
# In the future, this should probably get done for all
# of these guys.
